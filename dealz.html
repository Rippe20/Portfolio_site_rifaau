            <p>A web app that shows its customers the best deals and discounts in their proximity.</p>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>A lot of people are tired of going through thousands of newspapers looking for the perfect deal
                        or discount. Or their inbox is full of newsletters. It also takes a lot of time to go through
                        all the newsletters and individual websites if you are trying to find a good deal.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>An online platform that shows the deals and discounts close to the users or close to the location
                        they want. This should also provide a way of narrowing down the information so they can find the
                        required information fast and effectively.

                                dissatisfaction, needs and wants with current products, in order to determine how DEALZ
                                could enhance the experience.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>2 people said they are not fans of shopping but they still check on discounts
                                        online. People check online for information rather than physical newsletters.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>I was surprised by the one person wanting to add an option to search for
                                        sustainably
                                        produced goods. That was something that never crossed my mind.</li>
                                    <li>People are not too keen on signing up for too many apps.</li>
                                    <li>Each store needs a different app for each store to access its discounts.</li>
                                    <li>All 3 participants wanted to have a feature that would help them find the
                                        information they need quickly and accurately.</li>

                                product addresses the needs, frustrations, and goals of its users.</p>

                        <p>To begin the design process, sketches were used to brainstorm ideas and determine essential
                            elements for each screen and a user flow was established. I then created a Paper prototype
                            for
                            initial user testing.</p>

                            <h4>Usability testing</h4>
                            <p>Once a clickable prototype was finalized, it was tested. The goal was to test out the
                                application on a mobile browser and get feedback to improve the usability. Observations
                                were
                                made on how they interact with the application and complete basic tasks.</p>
                            <em>Objectives</em>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Measure how quickly participants are able to find a business they like.</li>
                                <li>Use the search function with filter to see if it can be improved.</li>
                                <li>find out if the navigation options are easy to find and use.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <em>Tasks</em>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Search for stores that offer the items you want.</li>
                                <li>Use the filter options to narrow down the search.</li>
                                <li>Start navigation to the desired store.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <em>Findings</em>
                            <p>The prototype was easy to use and users were Happy with the user flow. The search
                                function
                                worked as it was hypothesized. How ever 2 areas for improvement were found during the
                                tests
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>There was no escape hatch that takes you back to homepage or go 1 page back</li>
                                <li>No opening hours information.</li>

                            <h4>Typography</h4>
                            <p>Dealz was designed with user experience in mind. I chose the Roboto typeface for its
                                clean and modern design, which made it easy to read on screens of all sizes. Through
                                user testing, I found that Roboto was well-received by our target audience, who
                                appreciated its clarity and simplicity</p>
                            <br>

                        <div>
                            <h4>Colors</h4>
                            <p>I chose a vibrant orange to signify discounts and savings, a light sky blue to represent
                                reliability and trust, and a dark gray create a clean and modern background.</p>
