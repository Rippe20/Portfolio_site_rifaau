                    <h4>The Problem</h4>
                    <p>A lot of people are tired of going through thousands of newspapers looking for the perfect deal
                        or discount. Or their inbox is full of newsletters. It also takes a lot of time to go through
                        all the newsletters and individual websites if you are trying to find a good deal.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The Solution</h4>
                    <p>An online platform that shows the deals and discounts close to the users or close to the location
                        they want. This should also provide a way of narrowing down the information so they can find the
                        required information fast and effectively.

                            <p>Once a clickable prototype was finalized, it was tested. The goal was to test out the
                                application on a mobile browser and get feedback to improve the usability. Observations
                                were
                                made on how they interact with the application and complete basic tasks.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <em>Findings</em>
                            <p>The prototype was easy to use and users were Happy with the user flow. The search
                                function
                                worked as it was hypothesized. How ever 2 areas for improvement were found during the

                                clean and modern design, which made it easy to read on screens of all sizes. Through
                                user testing, I found that Roboto was well-received by our target audience, who
                                appreciated its clarity and simplicity</p>

                                reliability and trust, and a dark gray create a clean and modern background.</p>
